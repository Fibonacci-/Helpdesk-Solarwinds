## Synopsis

This app provides access to your installation of Solarwinds compatible ticketing system. You must already have an installation of Solarwinds compatible ticketing system somewhere, this app does not make a ticketing server for you.

## Motivation

Solarwinds does not provide an app for their ticketing system, and their mobile site is based off the first iPhone's design. It's terrible, and should be replaced.

## Installation

You can install the app on Google Play at this link: 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helwigdev.helpdesk

Otherwise, you can always clone this repository via IntelliJ and build an APK manually. 

## Contributing
